# tr-pairingExercise - TV Keyboard Calculator
Pairing exercise

This was a simple pairing exercise aimed to create a tool that could calculate the number of
'moves' required to enter a word on an on-screen keyboard using a remote with left,right,up,down 
buttons.

Notes:
- The cursor always starts on the letter a (top left)
- Remember to also press OK to "accept" each character.
- Take a direct route from one character to the next
- The cursor does not wrap (e.g. you cannot leave one edge and reappear on the opposite edge)
- A "word" (for the purpose of this exercise) is any sequence of characters available on my virtual "keyboard"
